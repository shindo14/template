			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Gangnam Style, published in July 2012, soon became the first in Gaon music chart in Korea(Sports Gyonghyang, 2012). The song was liked by many, but nobody knew what would happen next: within weeks, the song went viral, and then pandemic. It recorded top at Billboard social chart, Itunes music video chart, second at Bilbord single chart(Benjamin, 2012), and received new media award from American Music Award(People, 2012). Gangnam Style was the first video to reach a billion views on YouTube(Gruger, 2012), and went further to record over 1.9 billion views. There were hundreds of parodies and remixes of the song, and Psy came under the sudden spotlight of the world’s listeners. Psy went on a world tour in dozens of countries for more than a hundred concerts, with nearly every one of them being a huge success. Gangnam Style was everywhere; the song could be heard from the clubs of Ibiza to a college dorm party in Michigan. It was safe to say dozens of trick-or-treaters dressed in sky blue jackets and thick black shades filled up streets of America on Halloween. Psy even had a chance to sing at New Year’s event at Times Square. There were over 1500 people 2 hours before the show(Rudegeair and Roumeliotis, 2013). He was on Times magazine. It was evident that it was not just America, but almost the whole world knew Gangnam style and loved it, that it has now become a signature piece of 2012 pop-culture. </p>
