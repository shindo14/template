  <p>  Suddenly, acute scream and moan filled the room. The disabled patient due to spinal disk dislocation was being carried into the hospital by a stretcher, and the tension of emergency room was heavy enough to make me sweat. His pain was severe enough to drop his tears, and it was obvious that urgent care was needed. The doctors took MRI and CT scan of his body and concluded that his fourth and fifth spinal disks were punctured. In ordinary cases of this symptom surgery is recommended. However, he received a different type of treatment. The hospital I was shadowing in specialized in a treatment method called “Chuna”, a noninvasive, nonsurgical method of treating dislocated spinal disks. Doctor Shin, a Korean medical doctor took the wheel to start the process. Dr. Shin tried not to give a lot of stress to the patient; he was ready with a proper mixture of small talks to relieve his patients’ pain and professional questions about his symptoms. He calmed the patient and applied different pressure on his back and hip; every time he did so the patient responded differently. He marked the area where the patient claimed to be painful with O and X symbols. Overall, it looked like a chess dial. Dr. Shin explained that the O stands for the strongest pain and X for the weakest. After the  “pain mapping”was done, a nurse brought in a pack of thin, lengthy acupuncture needles. Dr. Shin started to skillfully apply acupuncture needles into the “pain boxes” he drew. Then, he had the patient stand up on his foot with the support of two other physicians in the room. At first, the patient started to yell and shiver with pain, which made me doubt whether the procedure was legitimate. The physicians supporting the patient started to walk slowly with him, allowing him to apply gentle pressure on his feet. A miracle - which I believe there are no other ways to explain what I observed- occurred and the patient were able to walk with the support of only one, further started to walk on his own.   Hallway was full of cheers and applauses, and other patients and physicians crowded up to see the patient – who five minutes ago seemed almost paralyzed – walk by himself.. The patient laughed like a child who just received his birthday present, and then started to cry and thanked Dr. Shin and his staff with his best effort.</p>

<p>  In fact, Dr. Shin is my father. He is a Korean Medical Doctor(KMD), who graduated from a school of Korean medicine and has been practicing Korean medicine like acupuncture, physical therapy and tang-yak, traditional Korean prescription for more than 20 years now. I shadowed him and his Korean medical staff in “Jaseng Oriental Hospital”, a hospital located in Seoul, South Korea specializing in nonsurgical, non-invasive treatments of spinal disorders. When I started my shadowing session, I was still skeptical about Korean medicine; perhaps because I spent most of my adolescent life in England or perhaps because I have been quite exclusively exposed to Western medicine all my life. People argued, and I agreed without really pondering deeply about it, that Eastern medical techniques, or “oriental medicine”, were unscientific and outdated. Critics of Eastern medicine believe that the principle is an ineffective and incompetent heritage from the past. For me, I did not have a strong opinion towards it but agreed with the point that it was more or less a result oriented principle, rather than process-oriented. I thought that eastern medicine was without a concrete foundation of scientific knowledge, that the procedure was considered effective as long as the patient shows progress regardless of whether proper procedure being taken. My first image of eastern medicine was that it was not logical or legitimate medical philosophy.</p>

<p>  In some way, however, I felt sympathy for Korean medical doctors in Korea as they are generally less respected by western medical doctors even though they completed same hard and patience-requiring education for 6 years. However, I had to agree to some extent that there are many Korean medical doctors who do not keep up with modern medical technology, and take advantage of the medical information imbalance so that they can sell more prescription. Their inappropriate attitudes affected the reputation of other Korean medical doctors who truly devote themselves to taking care of patients and seek for better knowledge of medicine. Moreover, the price of herbal medicine in Korea is higher than that of western medicine, as most of the insurance plans do not cover eastern medicine. The majority of the patients who visit eastern medical clinics are relatively wealthy, and those who are not able to afford them have to go to ordinary hospitals regardless of their desire. Cumulatively, those who were not able to benefit from it started to criticize eastern medicine for its high price and ineffectiveness, resulting in the demand of redistribution of medical resources.</p>

<p>  However, my attitude towards eastern medicine changed completely after witnessing its effectiveness. The “Chuna” technology cured most of its patients without any major side effects, and the principles were logical and systematic enough to educate doctors from overseas. AS a matter of fact, many foreign doctors were passionate about learning the Chuna technique, and one of them actually received a Korean medical degree and now works for the Jaseng foundation. I had some chances to talk to Dr. Royer, one of few non-Korean KMD’s in Korea, on his passion about the Korean medicine. His passion about his decision inspired me, and his logic was specific and detailed.  He was self-driven yet selfless; willing to postpone or cancel their personal appointments to see more patients if necessary, with full appreciation and kindness towards them. On the other hand, he also wanted to test his theoretical skills in practice. One of the benefits of being a Korean medical doctor is that you can try new techniques of acupuncture, for acupuncture does not cause major side effects when done properly. One of the technique Dr. Kim, one of my mentors at the hospital, used to his patients  was “Yin-Yang control”. The Chuna’s original technology directs doctors to treat the body parts close to the origin of the pain or disorder. In contrast, Yin-Yang control applied acupuncture to the symmetrical side or corresponding area of the pain. Both treatment methods were proven effective. Doctors I met believed in themselves and effectiveness of Eastern medicine; I also wanted to become a person who can also believe in myself. , cure others, make them healthier, and eventually, happier.</p>

<p>  I still want to become a Western medical doctor, but now have an additional dream. Eastern medical techniques such as Chuna are not well known in western countries. Now that I have experienced and know that the eastern medical technique Chuna has so many medical benefits, I want to maximize its effect further by integrating Chuna of Eastern medicine and western medical techniques. By having a medical degree and learning Chuna, I would be able to utilize the different approach two types of medical systems to develop a better, more integrated and relevant medical techniques. I want to identify and systemize the principles of acupuncture by going into neuroscience and orthopedics In addition to the technological aspects, I want a patient to be able to receive the best care possible; Both western and eastern medical treatments have pros and cons, and I believed that the integration would produce a better result. Orthopedics have much prospect to help Chuna develop further; Orthopedics mainly focus on the structural components of bones and joints, whereas Chua focus more on its surrounding muscular functions and their strength. For example, Orthopedicians would treat a patient with shoulder dislocation with surgery. On the other hand, Chuna principle would apply hand massage maneuvers and acupuncture on the patient’s shoulder, strengthen its surrounding muscle to stabilize the dislocation. Another central dogma for Chuna was “self-healing ability”, which is a theory that a tissue which is not completely damaged can heal gradually over time. Once Chuna treatment successfully stabilize the dislocation or punctured disks, KMD’s use specialized herbal medicine called “Chung-pajun” to regenerate damaged tissues and to reduce pain by removing pain causing molecule, COX-2. Chuna also had integrated its manual with its herbal medicine and rehab techniques. If Chuna treatment only involved acupuncture techniques at the doctor’s room, I believe that a patient would not have completely cured. Chuna is now progressing towards globalization; MSU is conducting many researches on the change in patients’ blood status before/after acupuncture is applied. Chuna was also introduced in an alternative medical journals, and many foreign doctors want to learn it. My vision is to earn a medical degree, and expand Chuna’s globalization so that patients abroad can benefit from it.</p>
