			<h1> Remix </h1>

<p>SUBJECT: Reflection on Multimedia Remix Project</p> 
<p>This memo intends to analyze our group’s decisions in constructing a documentary based on an essay by one of our members, and reflect upon the effects of these choices in reaching out to our audience. Furthermore, this memo addresses the issues of collaboration and what resources we used in making of the documentary. </p>
<p>Our group’s topic was the role of Asian stereotype in the success of Gangnam Style. Since our object of choice was a very well known pop song that almost everyone inevitably saw or heard during 2012, we decided to minimize the introduction portion, and jump rather early into analysis. By conducting researches and interviews with students on their opinions on Gangnam Style, I could certainly gain a better, wider understanding of the song and the music video from various perspectives. For example, unlike myself who come from Korea originially, many students did not know about Psy before the song’s release and thus focus more on the song’s characteristics than on the singer. However, there were also problems; because Gangnam Style is a light pop song, people do not really pay attention to why they like the song, or why not. Many students listened to the song simply because it was popular, and thus some students did not have much to say on why they like the song. We invited those who had something to say, however, to interviews because we wanted to get the audience more involved. Our goal was to make our interviews in a cozier setting than street interviews, allowing the viewers to feel like they are in the same room. </p>
<p>In order to decide on the topic of the documentary, we discussed each member’s essays written this semester. Of all, my Cultural Analysis Project, an essay that scrutinized the role of Asian stereotype in the success of the viral song Gangnam Style, was chosen because we agreed the topic could be popular, controversial, and interesting. After we locked down the topic, we held strategy meetings as to how we would construct the documentary. We discussed and concluded that presenting a series of candid interviews with students that watched Gangnam Style would be fit. However, oone of the most challenging parts of the projects was deciding as a group. Half of our group was for including interviews with professionals such as professors in the documentary, and the other was against the idea. I personally felt that including an expert’s opinion would make the documentary more credible, but others believed that including only student interviews would be more attractive to our student viewers. At the end, we decided that we would go without professional interviews. </p>
<p>In researching for our interviews, YouTube and online newspapers were by far the most beneficial resources. We watched quite a few Gangnam Style music video and parodies, and chose the best ones that fit our purpose: one parody done by a Caucasian, and the other done by an Asian person. Scholarly Search Engines such as Google Scholar was not as effective as we imagined, and we got most of the information we needed from newspaper articles. Because Gangnam Style came out only a year and a half ago, hard copies of books on Gangnam Style was not found in libraries. </p>
<p>In collaborating for this documentary, our group met regularly to discuss how to get interviews and how to construct our documentary. As mentioned above, one of our longest discussions was on whether we would include expert opinions in the documentary. Mainly, we discussed strategies and policies, and seperately worked on making interview videos. Working in groups was particularly helpful in getting interviews, since it required a lot of time and inviting people. However, in editing and making the final version of the documentary, I must recognize that our team’s integrity was not as strong as our individual works. Editing was mostly done by just one person, and the others’ contributions were mostly individual interview videos. I think it would have been better if we designated people’s responsibilities before we shot the interview videos. If there were point person for each task such as getting interview shots, writing scenarios and editing, I imagine team members would have been more accountable. </p>
<p>It was not that difficult to plan our work in the project, since we decided that a good portion of our documentary would be candid interviews of students who watched Gangnam Style. We regularly met up to discuss interview questions and how to allign our interviews and other videos in the documentary, and went on to film individual interviews. If we had more time, I think I would push for including expert opinions in the documentary harder. I firmly believe that including interviews with professors in a documentary about such a delicate yet controversial is beneficial not only because it helps making the documentary more credible, but also makes the whole video more interesting. </p>
<p>We believe that our documentary is quite strong in that it features a very honest thoughts of students about one of the biggest pop culture craze in recent times. We decided including footages of peoples’ natural responses to and opinions on different versions of Gangnam Style music videos would be fit for the topic since it is crucial to analyze people’s thoughts in addressing the issue of racial stereotyping in pop culture. </p>
