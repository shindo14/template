			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>The Asian Stereotype of Americans still prevails now; it focuses on their asexuality, different skin color, lacking English ability and understanding of Western culture. It is difficult to find sexy, hot, handsome and/or beautiful Asian protagonists in Hollywood movies, the pinnacle of American pop culture. Sexy stars that are straight from Asia are virtually nonexistent. Asian main characters you can find usually focus on their hilariousness or eccentric and exotic abilities like martial arts. Jackie Chan is one of few successful Asian celebrities within America. In all of the movies that star Chan, his character speaks very poor English, despite he is in fact very well versed. His characters always matched with their Asian stereotypes, and many of them were huge successes.. Psy’s public image within America perfectly correlated with stereotype of the funny, eccentric Asian. It is not far-fetched to say that he intentionally downgraded himself by doing uncommon and hilarious acts that he would not have done in Korea. His image was completely stereotypical, and perhaps that was the core of his success. </p>
<p>Before Psy, There were many other Korean singers who entered western music industry, boasting their successes and album sales figures in Korea. In Korea, they were beyond loved; they were worshipped. They were the sex symbol of Korean youngsters and their success in Western music markets was regarded probable, if not a sure thing. However, none of them gained attention that is even close to that of Psy. For example, an idol group of singers called “Wonder Girls”, that was a complete success in Korea, went on to California with the goals of being launched right onto the top ranks of The Billboard. However, after about half a year, their albums were being sold in 99-cents sections in Walmart.</p> 
<p>It is odd that a group considered to be so hot in Korea gets negligible attention from America. It is well known that viewers and listeners prefer to watch and listen whatever makes them the most comfortable. From the fact that hot Asian movie stars or pop stars are extremely rare, it would not be too wrong to say that viewers and listeners are just not accustomed to seeing hot Asians on TV.  Maybe, the concept of “sexy celebrities straight from Asia” is just not comfortable with the viewers. If this is so - which the statistics from Hollywood silverscreen and Billboard chart argues to be so – then it is not unreasonable to doubt that the reason the sexy Asian girl groups have failed was that because the non-Asian viewers were too used to the Asian stereotype, their appearance and sex appeal threatened the concrete image of what Asians should look and sound like. </p>
<p>As Gangnam style got more popular, it gained more influence. It changed the way some people thought about Asians. Because the image of Asians from the media is asexual and funny, for some people, it was suddenly OK to make fun of Asians quoting Gangnam Style. All of a sudden, I was getting recommendations to wear Psy’s costume and dance in many parties. At first, it was a joke, but as Gangnam Style got more famous, it became a culture. As time passed, people started to wonder if it was usual for young people in Korea to dress like Psy. At that moment I realized: not only did Gangnam Style benefit from misleading Asian stereotypes, it also was reinforcing and distributing it further. Ironically enough, by becoming the most loved single of 2012, Gangnam Style successfully singled out Asian males living outside Asia.</p>
