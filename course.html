<p>  Writing in and of itself is the epitome and essence of the expression of human intelligence. Not only is writing crucial in everyday communication that has become ubiquitous in our lives such as emails or text messages, it is the very backbone of intellectual communications. Writing enables one to jump over the temporal, spatial – and sometimes, even language – barriers and reach the readership. A writer can essentially write about anything; as we have explored in this course, she can write about her personal experience, her morality and values, an academic report, or an event that happened far around the globe, several decades ago. What is more fascinating about writing is that the readers can take time and reflect upon their experience and knowledge in interpreting the writer’s work. This is the key difference between writings and speeches, TV programs, and any other instant medium of communication. When reading, the reader tries and engages in interpreting the intentions of the writer. This active intellectual activity is something more than merely understanding what the writer put on the paper; in order to read well, the reader has to recognize the temporal, social, academic and political background of the writer and interpret the piece accordingly.</p>
	<p>WRA 110 is a course that teaches you what writing should be like and what reading should be like. Surprisingly, not that many incoming freshman, including myself, know what they really are. Obviously, they all graduated from high schools and finished not a small number of writing projects in their English classes. However, in WRA 110, they learn to write college-style; proper citations are a must, and careful pre-planning, drafting, and proofreading are required. Compared to high school English course, WRA 110 requires the student to participate in intellectual engagements that are fundamentally deeper and wider. One has to research thoroughly her topic, sometimes plan and do interviews, collaborate with classmates, and strive to construct a flow of logic that is smooth yet rigorous.</p>
	<p>Excluding the final retrospective essay, WRA 110 requires the student to submit four different essays and a documentary: Lived Experiences, Cultural Analysis, Formal Research, and Multimodal Remix memo and video. Each project are designed to let the student learn different styles of writing on a variety of topics. </p>
	<p>The first essay, Lived Experiences, was a well-mixed analysis of personal experiences, technology, and career plans. The student has to compose a narrative describing and explaining a piece of technology that impacted her life, and her career plans and major choices. My essay was on a Korean medical technology called “Chuna”, a traditional acupuncture technology that has recently been gaining recognition in Korea in treating spinal disk dislocation. In writing about what Chuna is and how it has impacted my life; I realized that I must take into account who the audience will be. This is something that is crucial when writing. One must know who will be reading her writing or, at least, who the target audience will be. For example, the description of the technology I was required to do in my first essay would have been vastly different if I were writing for a group of Korean doctors who are already familiar with the technology. Instead, I was writing for a college project in America; therefore, I learned that I had to be careful in explaining what the technology was. The issue of knowing the target audience arose repeatedly in the following essays as well. For example, in the fourth assignment where my group made a documentary about the success of Gangnam Style, I knew that most people who will be watching the video will know who Psy is and have heard Gangnam Style before. Therefore, I minimized the description portion in order to avoid making my viewers/readers bored even before the main part started. Something else I learned in the first project was that sometimes, a writer must remain concise and straightforward in order to be more convincing. In explaining my major choice and career plans, it was more effective to remain on track and talk about what the technology made me think about than going into a detailed explanation of my views and values. </p> 
	<p>If Lived Experiences teaches the students to consider the readers and to remain concise in writing, the second assignment, Cultural Analysis teaches the students how to logically analyze a cultural phenomenon. This assignment was my personal favorite because before WRA 110, I never had a chance to sit down to ponder and analyze an interesting piece of modern culture. My essay was on the global success of Psy’s song, Gangnam Style. In this project, I built a logical connection between the Korean pop star’s overnight rise to superstardom and persistent Asian stereotyping in America. Compared to the first assignment where I learned to adapt my writing style and structure according to my target audience, I learned how to ‘connect the dots’ in topics that are seemingly far apart. Obviously, Asian stereotyping was not the only attributable factor in Psy’s success. Therefore, it was important to draw effective logical connections between aspects of racial stereotyping, past cases of Korean stars in global music industry, and the particular case of Psy. In doing so, much in-class and out-class researching was needed. The most important part, in my opinion, was that selecting necessary information from others; since Gangnam style is a fairly new song, few academic discussions could be found. Because it was a huge pop hit, however, the amount of news articles and TV analyses about its success was overwhelming. It was quite helpful because in writing for my project, I learned how to filter information according to relevance, and analyzing the views that support my opinion and logically understand and criticize those opposite. </p>
	<p>While the first and second assignment was meaningful and interesting, the third assignment, Formal Research, was the most helpful in understanding what writing and reading are. In Formal Research project, students studied how an academic discipline required its scholars to publish their researches and how to read the academic publications. As my major is pre-medical studies, my topic of choice was medical biology. In this assignment, I interviewed two professors, one of them a doctor, and a researcher to have expert opinion on how researching and publishing are done. Furthermore, I learned to thoroughly read an academic article, which was quite different than reading as leisure because it required me to fully engage in understanding the purpose, methodology, hypothesis, and implications of the results. Because reading academic articles require analytic and critical thoughts, there were specific ways to read a biology article; such as starting from the abstract, then visual data, the conclusion, and lastly, methods. Furthermore, I could understand how researches were planned and writings were done in an academic setting. Not only is academic writing a medium of communication among current researchers, they are a process of knowledge accumulation that later gets translated into textbooks. Therefore, academic writing serves a very specific purposes of communication and recording. Through this assignment, one could understand how literacies are produced and read in order to communicate in the field of medical biology. </p>
	<p>The fourth assignment, Multimedia Remix Project, was one that required meta-analysis of one of my essays and treansmediating it to a video documentary. As one of the last assignments of WRA 110, this project took all the writing skills students have learned in this semester plus a good collaboration among group members. My group decided that my cultural analysis essay was worth producing as a documentary, so naturally I became the point person in coordinating production meetings, interview planning, and the actual production of the video work. In doing so, I have learned that coordinating a group production was far different from writing by oneself; fair delegation was the key, yet I could not solely let one person take all the responsibility of one part for the sake of the logical integrity and the fluidity of the group work. Also, through this project, I learned how to orchestrate people with different opinions to produce a common work; for example, there was an instance half of my group wanted to invite a professor to interview for the documentary, and the other half did not. We had an almost overnight meeting over this issue, and finally came out with a solution that all of us agreed: we will not do the professor interview, but we will plan a more detailed set of questions for our student interviewees. </p>
	<p>The first two assignments helped me realize and learn the fundamentals of writing. In the first assignment, I learned that even though the writer himself may be familiar with the topic, the target audience typically are not. Therefore, when writing, one should always keep in mind who will read the piece, and optimize the structure and style of writing. Often, it may be helpful to include extra description or explanation for those who are new to the subject. The second assignment taught me to connect the dots. Often, one will write about more than one subject at a time; comparing, contrasting, or drawing a point previously unrecognized are crucial in writing. In order to do so, students will have to be able to logically analyze the topics they are writing about, and construct a new yet relevant opinion based on the analyses. The points I learned from these first two assignments helped me maintain the structural and logical integrity of my writing throughout the rest of the course. </p>
	<p>The third assignment helped me learn how to plan and publish researches in a professional setting. Furthermore, I learned the importance of critical reading in academic writing. WRA 110 graduates will go on to write many more essays throughout their Michigan State University career, and quite likely afterward as well. In doing so, proper planning based on thorough and critical understanding of their subject matter will be essential. </p> 
	<p>Topping off the lessons I learned from the first three assignments was the last assignment. Much of this assignment was group work, and collaboration, good leadership, and each member’s ownership of the project were required. By meeting regularly to plan and execute our production, I put forth all the points I grasped in WRA 110: deciding on target audience, optimizing our approach to them, drawing logical and reasonable relations, all with careful researching and planning. </p>
<p>Before WRA 110, I must confess that I have only worked on very basic level of high-school writing. I was under the impression that after finishing writing, it was the readers’ job to fully understand what I have written. I spend little time pre-planning and drafting essays compared to the time I actually spent writing the piece. One can say that I was more of an impromptu writer, than a careful planner. Naturally, this has not reflected well on my writing grades; back then, however, it was difficult for me to understand what I was doing wrong. </p>
	<p>On the other hand, I must also confess that I was not the best reader in my class. I was under the impression that, when reading, it was the writer’s job to make sure he writes about what the readers can understand without trying too hard. Most of the time, I would jump into the middle of an academic article I had to summarize for my lab meeting, or skim through the important parts, without noticing that they were crucial in understanding the pieces. </p>
<p>Through WRA 110, students like myself can learn and practice important skills in writing such as strategically structuring your work so your target audience can read, view and understand better, or as drawing unseen logical connections between two seemingly unrelated subject matters. The most important point I realized from taking WRA 110 is that writing is not a one-person work. Although a writer often writes by herself, she works with her future reader. Identify with your future readers, discuss your topic with them , and finally, write for them. </p>
