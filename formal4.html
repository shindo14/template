			<p>If and when the research proposal is approved and the lab successfully is provided with proper funding, the researcher will be able to begin his or her research. During the research, the researcher may decide to collaborate with other scientists in the same lab, or even with other labs. Especially in medicine and biology, because the subjects – the patients or the organism of interest – may vary according to regions, the researchers may have to convene a multinational research team in order to achieve a broad and meaningful data. Dr. Andrew Jarosz, associate professor of plant biology at Michigan State University, highlighted in a personal interview that collaboration with other scientists is crucial, because no modern scientist can be an expert of everything (A. Jarosz, personal interview, Mar 14, 2014).</p>
<p>The beginning of any good research in order to write a meaningful biology article is to plan it well. The biggest question, or the ultimate purpose of the research, must be broken down into several smaller and more specific questions that can be studied separately. For example, if one were to study the effect of cigarette smoking and cancer, he or she will have to decide what demographic to target, what aspect of cigarette smoking will be studied, how the carcinogenic (or anti-carcinogenic) effects will be measured, and so on. After the planning is finalized, then the research can start. Dr. Daniel Jones, director of mass spectrometry at Michigan State University wrote in an email interview that there are several steps to designing and executing a research plan, which are defining objectives, constructing hypothesis, and deciding on the repertoire of experiments. Dr. Jones emphasized that research planning should focus on a mechanistic question – how does this happen? – followed by a careful planning of experiments (D. Jones, personal communication, Mar 12, 2014). </p>
<p>While conducting experiments, the data must be carefully collected and accumulated. It is important to report and record every bit of results one finds. No data is insignificant, and the pieces that at first seem meaningless or odd can sometimes point to surprising discoveries. In the past, when the use of computers and internet was not as ubiquitous as it is now, it was quite difficult to share data from individual labs with other researchers. However, now that almost every piece of data can be shared real-time, collaboration with other labs would not pose any problems in sharing and analyzing the data together. </p>
<p>It is also important to keep in mind that the trend of the results may differ significantly from what you expected. Dr. Jarosz advised that researchers first do a set of smaller experiments to figure out any technical difficulties or unexpected trend. If found, the unexpected trend must be treated as an indication of a new finding, or an omittance of an important variable in your study. Therefore, observing a small set of pre-experiments is important in making your study more rigorous(A. Jarosz, personal interview, Mar 14, 2014).</p>
<p>After the experiments are done, the accumulated data shall be analyzed and if necessary, converted into visual charts or graphs for easier understanding of audiences. The visuals used in a scientific article to help the audience understand the material better are called figures. Pfeifer et al.(2002) used a good amount of charts and tables to better let the readers know about their findings. Visuals help readers not only understand faster, but deeper because they convey the overall trend of the results otherwise might have gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>Although there can be many subtypes of figures, there are two main types of ways of representing data: raw and interpreted. Raw data figures usually are tables with direct results from experiments. This type of figure can give a reader a more thorough and detailed understanding of what came out from the experiments, but it can almost always be harder for the reader to grasph the overall trend or discover a pattern. The second type of figures is illustrated visuals. This type of figures are not direct entries of data, but visuals that are digested and interpreted by the researchers and illustrate the overal trend of the data. Although this type of figures does not provide the readers with specific numeric values of data, it helps the readers gain a more profound and fundamental understanding of what is going on in the research.</p>
<p>Moraghan(1983) used figure 1 in order to record a group of raw data from the experiments and researches. It may be specific in detail, however it does not provide the trend of overall data collected. For academic journals, it is important to submit the article which is readable to the audiences. Occasionally, researchers may need to insert table in their writing. However in general, it is evident that visual graph and chart is favoured as it shows the overall trend of the data collected. On the other hand, Pfeifer et al.(2002) used figure 2 to both contain specific raw data and show the overall trend of the data. This type of visual is called the pie chart, and this is best for representing data from individuals with for different subjected groups. </p>
<p>In addition to writing materials and methods and results, the researchers obviously need to discuss the meanings of their findings. This part is arguably the most important part of one’s scientific writing because discussion is where the researcher can voice his or her interpretation and arguments about their results. There are no specific regulations or rules to follow when writing discussion, other than one should strictly to qualitative and quantitative scientific reasoning. Quite often, novice researchers try to back their arguments with too little data; this is rather a conjecture or an educated guess, than a discussion. In discussion, authors should focus on analyzing existing data. If need be, it could be a good idea to include a conjecture and a plan for further studies. Pfeifer et al.(2002), using their statistical analysis of tobacco use and the frequency of induced mutation in lung cancer patients, argued that tobacco products are positively correlated with the incidence of cancer, and they further argued that not only are they correlated, but tobbaco use may cause the development of cancer. As in this case, discussion section is a good place to develop mere numbers to meaningful findings. </p>
<p>Dr. Jarosz advised that researchers may want to write the methods and materials section first, since it is what they plan the first, then the results secton followed by discussion. To increase the smoothness of the logic flow, he advised it may be wise to write the introduction last(A. Jarosz, personal interview, Mar 14 2014).</p>
<p>If the research used data and hypothesis from other sources, as is almost always the case, the author must include references. Many scholarly journals use experimental datas from other researches, and they cite the references at the end of the paper. For example, Pfeifer et al.(2002) discovered that tobacco products cause an increase in a G to T convergence DNA sequence, increasing the probability of causing a lung cancer. In developing their hypothesis and writing the introduction, the researchers employed data from other published articles and databases. In cases like this, the reference page must include which paper the data came from. Also, different styles have different structures for references, but one thing in common is that the structures must be strictly adhered. When including references, there is no limited number of articles or databases. However, usually only primary and secondary articles are generally accepted as proper references. Primary and secondary articles are review articles and research publications in peer-reviewed journals. On the other hand, tertiary publications, such as textbooks that use primary and secondary research results are usually not recognized as proper referneces.</p>
<p>Once the writing is complete and proofreadings are done, the researcher shall prepare to get his or her writings to get published. Dr. Jones emphasized that in terms of publishing an article, it is important to choose the right journal, because different journals have different strenghts and weaknesses(D. Jones, personal communication, Mar 12, 2014). When researching the journal, read typical content in the journal with submission guidelines to check whether it correlates with your research. For example, Pfeifer et al.(2002) publisehd their paper in a journal called Oncogene, a medical journal that specialize in gene-level mutations in the development of cancer. Publishing one’s paper in a relevant journal will increase the chance of the article getting accepted, and the readership of the article. </p>
<p>After one submits his or her paper to a journal, it may take weeks to even months to have the paper accepted or declined. Usually, journals have a board of experts that review the quality and legitimacy of the submitted papers. It is quite rare for a paper to be accepted at once; usually, the editors require several rounds of proofreading and updating in order to have the paper in line with the editing philosophy of the journal. If this is the case, the authors should read carefully the comments from the board of experts, and update their writing accordingly. It is not rare for papers to be declined from journals. Usually, rejection happens because the editors found the scientific grounds inadequate or the reasoning of the paper unagreeable. If this happens, the researchers can redo the research and update the paper, or submit the original paper to another journal that might accept it. </p>
<p>Publishing in a trade journal has a different set of requirements from publishing in a scholarly journal. Usually, a trade article highlights a breakthrough in the field of medical biology. While an academic article only focuses on the research, a trade article can discuss anything from the personal backgrounds of the author to the commercial usage and implications of the finding. An online post in a trade journal named Society of Biology, for example, introduces a PhD student at University College of London who won a gold medal at SET for Britain awards in 2013. The article only briefly lights the contents of the finding, but focuses more on the authors other works, and her future plans of study(Society of Biology Blog, 2013). </p>
<p>In order to write a good research paper, one must first read a good amount of articles in peer-reviewed journals. This serves two purposes: one is that it helps the researchers keep up with the state-of-the-art trend of the researches in biology, and the other is that it helps educate new researchers in how to plan and execute researches and publish the results. As mentioned above, scientific articles, unlike news articles, have specific structures and styles that can be unfamiliar when encountered for the first time. Knowing how to read a biology article well is just as important as knowing how to write an article well. </p>
<p>Reading science journals requires analytic and critical thoughts. Because most biology articles follow a strict structures, there are specific ways to read them. </p>
<p>First, fully read the abstract. An abstract is a summary which provides brief information about the overall hypothesis and predictions within the paper. Abstract also give the readers brief introductions about the findings and their implications. Even if you do not intend to read the full article, if you find the title of the article relevant to your research, it is always a good idea to carefully read the abstract. </p>
<p>Second, skim the visual data, such as graphs, tables and charts. Those figures would provide the overall trend of the data collected from the experiment, thus allowing you to understand the paper faster. </p>
<p>Third, read the discussion section in detail. The discussion section, read after reading the abstract, will let you know what the author argues, and why he or she reasons so. If curious, do look into materials and methods sections or results section. Material and methods section is particularly relevant to those who are looking to design a similar experiment. The results section can be relevant to those who are trying to analyze a set of similar data. </p>
<p>Fourth, write a brief summary about the article. Because the article reading consumes time, writing a brief summary would allow the reader to save time for his or her repeated reading. However, it is crucial to keep all the key points and scientific essence remained as eliminating them would differ the intended purpose of the article. </p>
<p>Quite often, biological research findings are closely connected to real-life economic issues since medical and biological knowledge deeply impacts government policies and regulations on objects of massive markets such as cigarette sales, pharmaceutical products, and food. For example, Gruning(2006) pointed out that tobacco companies have long been tobacco companies have long been funding scientists and doctors to research and argue that tobacco products are not as harmful as media suggests. The authors noted that public health and research projects were organized by tobacco companies in Germany and the US, and the extent of tobacco industry influence over the scientific research community in the developed countries is profound. Dr. Jones argued that the difference between a privately funded research and a research funded by a university or a research institute largely lies in the goals. While academic researchers have the freedom to pursue a variety issues with hypothesis testing, a company’s objective is to maximize profit. Therefore, the researchers at companies are expected to publish results that help improve the company’s performance. In his interview, Dr. Jones gave a case of an undisclosed company that tested their new drug, whose management decided to limit the range of tests to those that will only give back positive results for the drug(D. Jones, personal communication, Mar 12, 2014). </p>
