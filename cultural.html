			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Before 2012, Psy was a nobody to virtually everybody in the world. After he released a single called “Gangnam Style”, however, he became a superstar overnight. One would not be exaggerating if she said Psy’s musical career can be divided into two: one before Gangnam Style, and one after. In the past, Psy was not known to anybody outside Korea. Even in his native country, he was famous, but not popular. It is clear that Psy would not have been so popular without his now legendary song Gangnam Style. In this essay, I would like to analyze Gangnam style’s success and address the not-so-hidden issue of Asian stereotyping in the song.</p>
