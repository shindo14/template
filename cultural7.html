			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Gangnam Style is a well-made song. It’s good, it’s fun, it’s easy; however, it is also misleading. Psy became the first widely-recognized K-pop star in the world because of his musical talent, hard work, and to some extent, negative Asian stereotypes so ubiqotous yet so well-hidden that no one dared to point out. Psy’s global success was possible because his song was fun and catchy while not threatening to the ever persistent stereotype of funny asexual Asian. There were a number of Asian artists who attempted to climb to the top of American and European pop culture, yet they all failed. Even those who briefly experienced the delight of global attention enjoyed their newly found fame no longer than mere weeks. If Psy was handsome and well-fit, viewers would have found his work to be for some reason uncomfortable, and thus Gangnam style would not have been such a global sweep. Gangnam Style’s rise to global pop culture hall of fame, while evidently showing the possibility of Asian culture being accepted as “mainstream”, only highlights the existing racial stereotypes and further works to reinforce them.</p>
