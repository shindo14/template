			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>Biological science, as an academic discipline first arose somewhere around the eighteenth century. Biology in its early days was primarily concerned with taxonomy, or the science of classifying organisms. Taxonomy was – and still is – particularly useful because it let people know what plants could be used as medicine and what could not be. Naturally, many doctors and pharmacists were also biologists , and each biologist had his or her own collection of data and idiosyncratic set of criteria in classifying them. As the discipline grew deeper and wider as a branch of major science, no single biologist could maintain their work on their own; soon, there was need for a shared way of researching and a way of communication between biologists. Like many other academic disciplines, letter correspondence among individual biologists developed to peer-reviewed journals that provided a common ground for biologists. </p>
