			<h1>Research Section</h1>
			<p>Modern scientific researches are very sophisticated and quite often require the use of expensive resources including research workforce, state-of-the-art experiment devices, and powerful analyzing computing systems. Naturally, one researcher can rarely fund his or her project on her own; most of the times, a researcher must compile and submit a document briefly describing the purpose and the goal of the research, called a research proposal, to a funding authority and have it approved in order to receive funds for the project. </p>
<p>In order to write a good research paper, one must first read a good amount of articles in peer-reviewed journals. This serves two purposes: one is that it helps the researchers keep up with the state-of-the-art trend of the researches in biology, and the other is that it helps educate new researchers in how to plan and execute researches and publish the results. As mentioned above, scientific articles, unlike news articles, have specific structures and styles that can be unfamiliar when encountered for the first time. Knowing how to read a biology article well is just as important as knowing how to write an article well.</p>
<p>The beginning of any good research in order to write a meaningful biology article is to plan it well. The biggest question, or the ultimate purpose of the research, must be broken down into several smaller and more specific questions that can be studied separately. For example, if one were to study the effect of cigarette smoking and cancer, he or she will have to decide what demographic to target, what aspect of cigarette smoking will be studied, how the carcinogenic (or anti-carcinogenic) effects will be measured, and so on. After the planning is finalized, then the research can start. Dr. Daniel Jones, director of mass spectrometry at Michigan State University wrote in an email interview that there are several steps to designing and executing a research plan, which are defining objectives, constructing hypothesis, and deciding on the repertoire of experiments. Dr. Jones emphasized that research planning should focus on a mechanistic question – how does this happen? – followed by a careful planning of experiments (D. Jones, personal communication, Mar 12, 2014). </p>
