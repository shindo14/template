			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>In an era that is filled with instant, easy-to-watch TV programs, people are provided with such a vast amount of information that sometimes make it hard for them to distinguish what is real and what is fictitious. Ironically, when there is an overflow of information, people seem to be more easily brainwashed when there was little or no information; possibly because people are not willing to actively think about what they are watching. When people are unwilling to disengage from being exposed to biased information, it is best to attempt to make the information correct. In the United States, many universities, including state universities employ the policy of affirmative action. In order to protect and promote an underrepresented population in academia, universities give certain advantages to students from minor ethnic backgrounds. Since this policy has been in effect in education for some time, it would not be unreasonable to propose to extend this to the field of visual arts like TV and movies. If this ‘cultural affirmative action’ is introduced, then more attractive Asian people – which I think there are plenty – will appear on screen and in time, viewers will get accustomed to seeing them on TV./</p>
