			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>Psy initially did not gather the same amount of attention in Korea. Gangnam Style did place the first on music charts, but it was usual as newly released albums from famous singers easily rise to the top for a week or two. He was on TV a lot, but – not surprisingly considering his well-balanced yet humorous manners of carrying himself – mostly on comedy shows, not music programs. </p>
<p>Surprisingly to many music critics in Korea, Gangnam Style was a world class success without any match in domestic music industry of Korea. No Korean singer before Psy rose to world stardom so fast or so long. Psy was covered in evening news, newspapers, music shows, and world famous comedy programs like Saturday Night Live. People did flashmobs of Gangnam Style in New York, Berlin, Seoul, Paris and more. The flashmob activity clearly illustrates its success; over 20,000 people gathered up in Trocadero square in paris(Off.tv 2012). Consequently, Psy’s success had intrigued many Koreans, opening up opportunities for Psy to become popular in Korea as well. After Psy’s success, Psy held a free concert in Seoul square in front of Seoul city hallwhich over 80,000 people attended(Lee, 2013). This concert was live broadcasted on Youtube, heating up the pandemic spread even further. Ironically, Gangnam Style’s success within Korea would not have been so huge without its success out of Korea.</p>
<p>What was so special about Gangnam Style? What was it about the song – or the singer – that appealed to the global audience who don’t even understand what the song is talking about? Granted, the song was funny; it stood out from Korean music industry filled with songs about love and sex. It did gain reasonable attention within Korea but not in global scale. </p>
<p>Maybe it was not the song itself, but its music video that was responsible for its success. It is doubtful whether this would be true. People loved Psy’s hilarious dance moves. The video of Gangnam Style was focused on Psy’s humorous image, making jokes and doing funny dances. In the music video, Psy was continuously disturbing others, swimming in public sauna, taking out a chair so a lady falls down, and tanning at a public playground. He was even looking at a yoga lady’s bottom explicitly. These components of the music video were against ordinary Asian sentiments, and could be frowned upon in Korean culture. It gained some attention and delights from young generation, but it failed to attract the older listeners. The young adults were more fascinated with other boybands or girl groups they were following. If it’s not the song or the music video, maybe the reason for Gangnam Styles success lies somewhere else: maybe, in the not-so-explicit fulfilling of Asian male stereotypes. </p>
