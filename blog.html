<h1>Lived experience project</h1>
<p>Lived experience project was different to ordinary projects we have encountered throughout my academic writing career. For a person who experienced multicultural experiences, this project was a good opportunity for me to express my experiences. Through lived experience project, I was able to recall my memories and goals I made in youth. </p>
<h1>Cultural analysis</h1>
<p>Cultural analysis project was a special project for me as I have been wanting to write a project alike. I witnessed miscellaneous Asian stereotypes during my study in England, and this project fulfilled my interest. Cultural analysis project required a depth thinking of a discussion, and I believe this enabled me to express my thoughts in depth. </p>
<h1>Formal research</h1>
<p>This project was crucial in an aspect that it analyzed and evaluated ways scientists and doctors communicate each other. I understood the most common way of communication is via publishing scholarly journals, and I evaluated precautions and processes of writing academic journals. Through this project, I learnt how to write and publish an academic paper. </p>
<h1>Remix project</h1>
<p>This project was unique as it was the first work which involved group work. Individual works are much different to group works, as one’s idea may not be established as a group. Through group communication, I learnt how to simplify my ideas. In addition, this project required a production of group documentary. This was my first time making a documentary and it helped me a lot with editing skills. </p>
<h1>Course retrospective project</h1>
<p>Course retrospective project was a conclusive work. It required a summary and opinions about all the projects we have submitted, and by writing it I realized my achievements in both writing skills and logical thoughts. By writing all the projects we have been assigned to do, I got to think in a bigger aspects along with detailed descriptions. I was satisfied that I got to evaluate my acheivements and thoughts about the course. </p>
<h1>Blog</h1>
<p>Blog was an exclusive summary of all of the projects and works. Content wise, I had to write short summary of each works and projects we have encountered. Thus, I would be able to read it over time even after the course finishes. I would visit the blog whenever I feel dragged or struggle with other courses to stimulate me. </p>
<h1>Web version</h1>
<p>As a student who never encountered with any web work, producing web versions was a struggle. However, as I do so I realized it was not so difficult as I expected, further empowering me to challenge unachievable aspects. In practical view, web work provided a broad and basic skills of web production, which could be a valuable asset in future. </p>
<h1>Codecademy</h1>
<p>Codecademy linked to production of web version. Codeademy introduced the basis of HTML and CSS, and completing the protocols required allowed me to systematically understand the overall web production skills. It required a lot of time time, and I also learnt how to focus thoroughly for long term projects. </p>
<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<p>Portfolio requires a overall completion of codecademy, web version and blog. I had to make sure all categories link to others, which was a difficult for a person who was new to web production. However, through codecademy protocols I managed to finish the portfolio. </p>
<h1>In class activity 1</h1>
<p>The purpose of the video is to demonstrate a poem which represents the narrater's feelings towards his poem which he wrote in past and his uncle Ronnie.His toughts towards gay changed as he become homosexual, and it narrates his realization how his simmilar his life is with that of his uncle. The narrator starts his naration by explaining his feeling towards the poem. He first explains about his feelings after his realization of him as a gay, and its consequences including situation with his kids. He then narrates the simmilarity between his and his uncle Ronnie's life. The narrater tries to express his sympathy towards his uncle Ronnie, and he then changes his narrating direction to overall status of homosexual society. He points out the biased stereotypes of homosexuals;He then speak out to other homosexuals not to self condemn, but be proud of themselves. He tries to encourage other homosexuals by sharing his personal life experience. The structure of the narration is simple but concise, and it efficiently transfered the narrator's feeling towards him and his uncle, further entire homosexuals. This structure of narration can be helpful for my Lived Experience Project as its structure focused on narrating his feeling towards the subject, not biased to the information about homosexuality. I can revise my project and inject my feelings towards the medical technology "Chuna" which I mentioned. </p>

<h1>In class activity 2</h1>
<p>Q1. Identify the group of people targeted in the video</p>
<p>-Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny who play warcraft</p>
<p>Q2. Explains the social issue at hand</p>
<p>-The social issue in this episode is game addiction. The main characters try to defeat the provoking character by abandoning their real life routines. Even the gamemaker gets involved in the situation to help them. However, they do not stop gaming even after they achieved their goal. This episodes illustrates the seriousness of gaming addiction in youth. </p>
<p>Q3. Identify and critiques the video’s creator’s view on that social issue</p>
<p>-The creator has a negative thoughts about online gaming. He/she satires the consequences of gaming by putting pimples and make the characters look unwashed. Also, she points out that the gaming activity would not stop with a promise towards it , by showing their characters carry on playing Warcraft after their achievement. </p>
<h1>In class activity 3</h1>
<p>The imagery of Detroit& The Voiceover</p>
<p>-The images of factories implies that the Detroit’s main strength is related to manufacture, and the old buildings shows that Detroit is not a wealthy city. On the other hand, the image of the iron fist implies that they are strong and good at something, and in this case is the car manufacturing. Painting of people working also provides feelings that Detroit is a hard working city.Detroit is mentioned as the origin of car manufacture, and seemed as a city where the wealth is not a common factor. The city is described as a strong and rough, where overall standard of life is lower than other major cities such as New York and Chicago. The imagery of Detroit they introduce in the commercial is highly correlated with original imagery of Detroit, however they converted that imagery as a rough and strong in car manufacturing. </p>
<p>Inclusion of Eminem “Lose Yourself” </p>
<p>-Eminem is from Detroit, and unlike other underground rappers he managed to convert his background as a strong advantage. The legacy of Eminem is what the Cryssler wanted to follow, which is to convert the negative imagery of Cryssler into strong and beneficial marketing image. The song “Lose yourself” is describing the life that Eminem had to go through, and the song in the commercial is acting as a factor strengthens the imagery of Detroit they wanted in the commercial, which is tough, rough and strong. </p>
<p>The tagline “Imported from Detroit” </p>
<p>-As mentioned above, Detroit is described as a city of roughness, toughness and lower standard of living where people are generally not living luxuaries lives. However, by mentioning the “hardest steel comes from the hottest metal,” they are regarding Detroit as the hottest metal and their company being the hardest steel. Therefore, the tagline “Imported from Detroit” means they are the hottest steel, which is the best car company within the field. </p>
<h1>Library activity</h1>
<p>-Library activity was an activity prior to the formal research project. This activity allowed us to prepare the materials and sources needed for formal research project. The layout of the activity helped me to plan and schedule the actual project. </p>
<h1>Documentary worksheet</h1>
<p>-This was similar to the in class activities. Documentary worksheet required us to evaluate the video on possibility of involvement of ancient aliens on medical technology and its legacy. This was a refreshment as the purpose of the worksheet is to watch and analyze ordinary documentaries we encounter. I was interested in ancient aliens in prior to the activity, and this interest helped me to focus better for the activity. </p>
<h1>Final thoughts</h1>
<p>-Overall, WRA 110 course allowed me to improve both writing and logical ability. Availability of online source of help helped me to follow the course outside the class, and the production of web versions and portfolio via codecademy protocols enabled me to learn a valuable web technique for future use. I realized that the projects and activities interacted each other, allowing students to maximize their overall academic skills. </p>
