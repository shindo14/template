<h1>IN CLASS ACTIVITY ONE</h1>                
               
<p> The purpose of the video is to demonstrate a poem which represents the narrater's feelings towards his poem which he wrote in past and his uncle Ronnie.His toughts towards gay changed as he become homosexual, and it narrates his realization how his simmilar his life is with that of his uncle.
 The narrator starts his naration by explaining his feeling towards the poem. He  first explains about his feelings after his realization of him as a gay, and its consequences including situation with his kids. He then narrates the simmilarity between his and his uncle Ronnie's life. The narrater tries to express his sympathy towards his uncle Ronnie, and he then changes his narrating direction to overall status of homosexual society. He points out the biased stereotypes of homosexuals;He then speak out to other homosexuals not to self condemn, but be proud of themselves.  He tries to encourage other homosexuals by sharing his personal life experience.
  The structure of the narration is simple but concise, and it efficiently transfered the narrator's feeling towards him and his uncle, further entire homosexuals. This structure of narration can be helpful for my Lived Experience Project as its structure focused on narrating his feeling towards the subject, not biased to the information about homosexuality. I can revise my project and inject my feelings towards the medical technology "Chuna" which I mentioned.

<h1>IN CLASS ACTIVITY THREE</h1>
<p>   IN CLASS WORK 3</p>
<p>The imagery of Detroit& The Voiceover</p>
-The images of factories implies that the Detroit’s main strength is related to manufacture, and the old buildings shows that Detroit is not a wealthy city. On the other hand, the image of the iron fist implies that they are strong and good at something, and in this case is the car manufacturing. Painting of people working also provides feelings that Detroit is a hard working city.Detroit is mentioned as the origin of car manufacture, and seemed as a city where the wealth is not a common factor. The city is described as a strong and rough, where overall standard of life is lower than other major cities such as New York and Chicago. The imagery of Detroit they introduce in the commercial is highly correlated with original imagery of Detroit, however they converted that imagery as a rough and strong in car manufacturing.
<p>Inclusion of Eminem “Lose Yourself”</p>
-Eminem is from Detroit, and unlike other underground rappers he managed to convert his background as a strong advantage. The legacy of Eminem is what the Cryssler wanted to follow, which is to convert the negative imagery of Cryssler into strong and beneficial marketing image. The song “Lose yourself” is describing the life that Eminem had to go through, and the song in the commercial is acting as a factor strengthens the imagery of Detroit they wanted in the commercial, which is tough, rough and strong. 
<p>The tagline “Imported from Detroit”</p>
-As mentioned above, Detroit is described as a city of roughness, toughness and lower standard of living where people are generally not living luxuaries lives. However, by mentioning the “hardest steel comes from the hottest metal,” they are regarding Detroit as the hottest metal and their company being the hardest steel. Therefore, the tagline “Imported from Detroit” means they are the hottest steel, which is the best car company within the field.
