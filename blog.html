<h1>Lived experience project</h1>
<p> It was a well-mixed analysis of personal experiences, technology, and career plans. The student has to compose a narrative describing and explaining a piece of technology that impacted her life, and her career plans and major choices .Lived experience project was different to ordinary projects we have encountered throughout my academic writing career. For a person who experienced multicultural experiences, this project was a good opportunity for me to express my experiences. Through lived experience project, I was able to recall my memories and goals I made in youth. </p>
<p> My life experience of Chuna(eastern medical manipulative technique for spinal disorders) was introduced for the project. I have been raised under environment where I could witness spinal manipulative techniques on the first hand, and those experiences allowed me to dream becoming an osteopathic physician in future. For specific detailed narrations, I used stories with some physicians. It was a surprise that I recalled the conversations I had with them, further realizing how strong its impact was. In addition, throughout writing about what Chuna is and how it has impacted my life; I realized the significance of audience selection. For instance, , the description of the technology I was required to do in my first essay would have been vastly different if I were writing for a group of Korean doctors who are already familiar with the technology. Instead, I was writing for a college project in America. I had to be very careful and precise in explanation about the terminology I introduced. </p>
<p>On the other hand, lived experience project was difficult to plan and write. The minimum required number of words was 1200, which was a relatively large sum for a first year college student, providing many high school students did not encounter narrative writing skills.  </p>

<h1>Cultural analysis</h1>
<p>Cultural analysis project was a special project for me as I have been wanting to write a project alike. It taught how to logically analyze a cultural phenomenon. This assignment was my personal favorite because before WRA 110, I never had a chance to sit down to ponder and analyze an interesting piece of modern culture. Moreover, witnessing miscellaneous Asian stereotypes during my study in England corresponded with the hypothesis of the project. Cultural analysis project required a depth thinking of a discussion, and I believe this enabled me to express my thoughts in depth. Comparing to the first assignment where I learned to adapt my writing style and structure according to my target audience, I learned how to ‘connect the dots’ in topics that are seemingly far apart. This was a significance difference as cultural analysis project was a evaluative writing, whereas lived experience project was a pure narrative form. Because Asian stereotyping was not the only attributable factor in Psy’s success, it was important to draw effective logical connections between aspects of racial stereotyping, past cases of Korean stars in global music industry, and the particular case of Psy. In doing so, much in-class and out-class researching was needed. </p>
<p> There were difficulties and favors in the topic I chose. Since Gangnam style is a fairly new song, few academic discussions could be found. On the other hand, because it was a huge pop hit,the amount of news articles and TV analyses about its success was overwhelming. It was quite helpful because in writing for my project, I learned how to filter information according to relevance, and analyzing the views that support my opinion and logically understand and criticize those opposite. </p>


<h1>Formal research</h1>
<p>This project was crucial in an aspect that it analyzed and evaluated ways scientists and doctors communicate each other. I understood the most common way of communication is via publishing scholarly journals, and I evaluated precautions and processes of writing academic journals. Through this project, I learnt how to write and publish an academic paper. </p>
<p>Formal Research was the most helpful in understanding what writing and reading are. In Formal Research project, students studied how an academic discipline required its scholars to publish their researches and how to read the academic publications. I learned to thoroughly read an academic article, which was quite different than reading as leisure because it required me to fully engage in understanding the purpose, methodology, hypothesis, and implications of the results. Because reading academic articles require analytic and critical thoughts, there were specific ways to read a biology article; such as starting from the abstract, then visual data, the conclusion, and lastly, methods. </p>
<p>As a result, I could understand how researches were planned and writings were done in an academic setting.

<h1>Remix project</h1>
<p>This project took all the writing skills students have learned in this semester plus a good collaboration among group members. My group decided that my cultural analysis essay was worth producing as a documentary, so I became the leader in coordinating production meetings, interview planning, and the actual production of the video work.This project was unique as it was the first work which involved group work. Multimedia Remix Project, was one that required meta-analysis of one of my essays and treansmediating it to a video documentary . I learned how to regulate people with different opinions to produce a common work. For example, there was an instance half of my group wanted to invite a professor to interview for the documentary, and the other half did not. They claimed that by doing so, the length of the documentary may exceed the limited portion. Also, it was difficult to meet the flexible time amongst all the group members. Some member lived out of campus, thus we were unable to proceed in off-line state. As a result, we decided to use google drive as a solution.  As described, it was difficult to compress our ideas and contents within a short video clip. We as a group managed to simplify and compress our ideas into most solid form. Through this, I learnt that coordinating a group production was far different from writing by oneself. Through group communication, I learnt how to simplify my ideas. In addition, this project required a production of group documentary. This was my first time making a documentary and it helped me a lot with editing skills. </p>
<h1>Course retrospective project</h1>
<p>Course retrospective project was a conclusive work. It required a summary and opinions about all the projects we have submitted, and by writing it I realized my achievements in both writing skills and logical thoughts. By writing all the projects we have been assigned to do, I got to think in a bigger aspects along with detailed descriptions. I was satisfied that I got to evaluate my acheivements and thoughts about the course. </p>
<p> College writing, a very unique and different writing form from that of secondary education was a sincere refreshment for me. I practiced narrative skills during lived experience project, descriptive skills from cultural analysis, group work and web technique from remix project and conclusive during course retrospective project.</p>
<p> In writing course retrospective project, I realized that I should draw a brainstorm of thoughts about different projects I encountered. The vast sum of information tricked and confused me, further blindfolding me to miss details. The actual content within the project was highly repetitive, so I had to focus not to repeat my thoughts. This was difficult for me who have always wrote essays with enough and given discussions and opinions.</p>
<p>I did not expect our final project would be an evaluative essay about our achievements and thoughts. However, encountering new types of projects have been common thing throughout the course.</p>
<p>For the group part, we combined the summaries of lied experience project of the class and concluded with most common opinions and thoughts about the project. Communication between group members were superior, and I believe this was due to the collaborative experience from the remix project.</p>

<h1>Blog</h1>
<p>Blog was an exclusive summary of all of the projects and works. In the beginning, I was confused with blog to web versions(portfolio). In Korea, the general meaning of blog is same as web portfolio. Blog, as its content required fifteen opinions about the course. Instead of listing different opinions on a broad criteria, I decided to categorize it by fifteen works we have completed during the course, such as Lived experience project, Cultural analysis project, Multimedia remix project, Course retrospective project and in class activities such as activity one, two, and documentary worksheet. I wrote short summary and opinions about the each projects,Thus, I would be able to read it over time even after the course finishes. I would visit the blog whenever I feel dragged or struggle with other courses to stimulate me. </p>
<p> Writing blog section allowed me to understand the true purpose of each projects. For example, we already have summarized our thoughts about the course in the course retrospective area. However, by summarizing it again into a brief paragraph, I learnt how to simplify and summarize a work thoroughly. Upon writing the course retrospective project, I thought further summarization could not be made. However, by working on the blog which I have been completing on weekly basis, edition and omitting processes were done to improve the quality and quantity of the blog. By writing blog, it provided overall summary of the portfolio as well. The content within each section is important, but also the overall harmony amongst them is also critical towards quality of the portfolio as well.</p>
<h1>Web version</h1>
<p>As a student who never encountered with any web work, I must confess thatproducing web versions was a struggle. However, as I practiced and made my own blog and website throughouth the semester, I realized that it was not so difficult as I expected. Learning and being able to structure my contents on my own web space further empowered me to challenge myself constantly. In practical view, web work provided a broad and basic skills of web production. Now that I know how to design a basic, content-based website, I think I will try and learn to design a more sophisticated web sructure in the future, which could be a valuable asset. </p>
<p> Submitting the web version was tough for me, as I have never experienced such assignment before. Through Codecademy, I learned the principle of HTML by looking at the given template, which I believe helped significantly towards my web version.</p>
<p> The presence of web version enabled me to revise my previous projects and further peer reviewing those of others. Peer-reviewing projects of others allowed me to compare and contrast my writing skills to those of others. Apart from the peer-reviewing, there were many other benefits I experienced with the web version. Submitting web versions was truly a challenging yet rewarding experience that opened a new horizon for me. Now that I know what it’s like to work online, I feel like I can do much more than subbmiting only writings online. I hope that I can make my personal website where I can share my thoughts and experiences wider and deeper. </p>
<h1>Codecademy</h1>
<p> Codecademy was a web tool which trained me to be qualified in web production. As I did not have a web experiences, it was very useful in making html sources and submitting the web versions, further teaching me how to build a better portfolio. Because we were provided with a basic outline of html sources from Dr. Daniels, I was able to study both codecademy and provided work to increase the quality of portfolio.</p>
<p>Codecademy linked to production of web version. Codeademy introduced the basis of HTML and CSS, and completing the protocols required allowed me to systematically understand the overall web production skills. It required a lot of time time, and I also learnt how to focus thoroughly for long term projects. The estimated time required to complete the course was seven hours. However, because I wanted to actually learn how to use HTML thoroughly, I spent more time studying the course. As a result, I now became familiar and feel confident towards web production. Also, the logical flow between each criteria within codecademy allowed me to understand the process, not just memorizing it. </p>
<p> By doing the web version, I learnt how to make a paragraph by using <p> tags and other simple paragraphing. However, through codecademy I learnt detailed and varied orders such as making an ordered list by <li> and <or> tags. Also, learning how to upload images was also impressive. I realized how hard to make a web upon completing the codecademy course, and it triggered my interest. I am planning to complete more of programs in codecademy in future.
<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<p>Portfolio was a project that required the coordination of various assignments and projects I have completed this semester. Portfolio project was designing a sophisticated and relevant network of completion of codecademy, web version submissions and blog. I had to make sure all categories link to others, which was a difficult for a person who was new to web production. However, as semester progressed and I played and practiced with codecademy works and my blog, I realized that creating an online portfolio was not fundamentally different from creating an offline portfolio. I was under the impression that online works mostly required technical skills and that logic and proper analyses of contents came second. It was not true. Creating an online portfolio required just as much consideration on how to organize my writings efficiently and effectively so that my readers could understand them better like any offline portfolio. </p>
<p>Through creating the portfolio, I learned that finishing my writings were not the end, but a mere start. Once I was done putting my thoughts on paper or word processor, then it was a whole another job to recreate the written pieces into an online portfolio. Furthermore, by working through the project, I gained more confidence in handling online HTML structures. I feel that, from constructing my website, finishing Codeacademy assignments, and uploading web submissions, I gained enough experience to try and start the endeavor of creating my own personal website with much more contents than my writing. I am glad that I learned these skills through WRA 110. </p>
<h1>In class activity 1</h1>
<p>We watched a narrative video about homosexuality. The purpose of the video was to demonstrate a poem which represents the narrater's feelings towards his poem which he wrote in past and his uncle Ronnie. His toughts towards gay changed as he become homosexual, and it narrates his realization how his simmilar his life is with that of his uncle. The narrator starts his naration by explaining his feeling towards the poem. He first explains about his feelings after his realization of him as a gay, and its consequences including situation with his kids. He then narrates the simmilarity between his and his uncle Ronnie's life. The narrater tries to express his sympathy towards his uncle Ronnie, and he then changes his narrating direction to overall status of homosexual society. He points out the biased stereotypes of homosexuals;He then speak out to other homosexuals not to self condemn, but be proud of themselves. He tries to encourage other homosexuals by sharing his personal life experience. The structure of the narration is simple but concise, and it efficiently transfers the narrator's feeling towards him and his uncle, further entire homosexuals. I believe this structure of narration can be helpful for my Lived Experience Project as its structure focused on narrating his feeling towards the subject, not biased to the information about homosexuality. Before the activity, my view against homosexuality was somewhat neutral, that I did not really have an opinion against it. However, after watching the video clip and analyzing it, I now support the homosexuality as a personal choice. </p>

<h1>In class activity 2</h1>
<p>Q1. Identify the group of people targeted in the video</p>
<p>-Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny who play Warcraft were introduced in the video.</p>
<p>Q2. Explains the social issue at hand</p>
<p>-The social issue in this episode is game addiction. The main characters try to defeat the provoking character by abandoning their real life routines. Even the gamemaker gets involved in the situation to help them. However, they do not stop gaming even after they achieved their goal. This episodes illustrates the seriousness of gaming addiction in youth. </p>
<p> Gaming addiction is a rising social issue. On general aspects, playing game is not a social problem nor an illegal act. However, dismissing and avoiding real life responsibilities and works by devoting their valuable time in gaming may be a problem. Main victims of game addiction are young people and adolescents. This is because they are vulnerable towards controlling their joy.</p>
<p> The main problem that game addiction causes is violent acts amongst users. Because they can release their hidden angers, they tend to rely on gaming for their stress release. This can be a severe social problem as it will lower the overall level of education and social role amongst future social members. If they become violent and addicted towards gaming, the characteristics built at adolescent period may not change over time. This is a problem for the next generations, that their overall anger management ability may be lower than the generation before.</p>
<p> It is controversial whether the game addiction triggers the relief of anger. However, it is also evident that there are some statistical reviews about it, and they show high correlation between level of game addiction and ability to mange their anger. This episode tries to express the seriousness of game addiction.</p>
<p>Q3. Identify and critiques the video’s creator’s view on that social issue</p>
<p>-The creator has a negative thoughts about online gaming. He/she satires the consequences of gaming by putting pimples and make the characters look unwashed. Also, she points out that the gaming activity would not stop with a promise towards it , by showing their characters carry on playing Warcraft after their achievement. </p>
<h1>In class activity 3</h1>
<p>The imagery of Detroit& The Voiceover</p>
<p>-The images of factories implies that the Detroit’s main strength is related to manufacture, and the old buildings shows that Detroit is not a wealthy city. On the other hand, the image of the iron fist implies that they are strong and good at something, and in this case is the car manufacturing. Painting of people working also provides feelings that Detroit is a hard working city.Detroit is mentioned as the origin of car manufacture, and seemed as a city where the wealth is not a common factor. The city is described as a strong and rough, where overall standard of life is lower than other major cities such as New York and Chicago. The imagery of Detroit they introduce in the commercial is highly correlated with original imagery of Detroit, however they converted that imagery as a rough and strong in car manufacturing. </p>
<p>Inclusion of Eminem “Lose Yourself” </p>
<p>-Eminem is from Detroit, and unlike other underground rappers he managed to convert his background as a strong advantage. The legacy of Eminem is what the Cryssler wanted to follow, which is to convert the negative imagery of Cryssler into strong and beneficial marketing image. The song “Lose yourself” is describing the life that Eminem had to go through, and the song in the commercial is acting as a factor strengthens the imagery of Detroit they wanted in the commercial, which is tough, rough and strong. </p>
<p>The tagline “Imported from Detroit” </p>
<p>-As mentioned above, Detroit is described as a city of roughness, toughness and lower standard of living where people are generally not living luxuaries lives. However, by mentioning the “hardest steel comes from the hottest metal,” they are regarding Detroit as the hottest metal and their company being the hardest steel. Therefore, the tagline “Imported from Detroit” means they are the hottest steel, which is the best car company within the field. </p>
<h1>Library activity</h1>
<p>-Library activity was an activity prior to the formal research project. This activity allowed us to prepare the materials and sources needed for formal research project. The layout of the activity helped me to plan and schedule the actual project. </p>
<p> This allowed me to change my academic plans when publishing an academic paper. Library activity structured my thoughts and purposes of the project. I have chosen scholarly journals about incomes of physicians and their future aspects, and by listing them down, the whole drafting activity of the project became simple and precise. In academic writing, it is crucial to simplify the work, but maintain precise information and emphasizes within the writing. Library activity was just more than guideline and draft of the project, but was an useful tool which enabled me to flourish my ideas and thoughts. I would like to name the activity as personal assistance, that by writing down the information I need to find and evaluate, I get a grasp the style and structure my writing shall be.</p>
<p> College writing was different from that of secondary education. Thus, knowing how to improve is a critical factor succeeding in writing. Library activity was an outstanding activity which taught and guided me into college writing. It linked to all other academic discipline that I was studying, that I learnt how to find useful scholarly journals. Before, I was not feeling confident about finding the right journal and articles. It was a different story after the library activity, and I am satisfied that I learnt just more than writing skill, but researching and organization skills as well.</p>
<p> In addition, library activity enabled me to distinguish the appropriate article. There were various factors counting for its appropriateness, such as audience, purpose, citations, illustrations, author, and language tone. In future, I will use those aspects to check whether the article I choose is appropriate or not.</p>
<h1>Documentary worksheet</h1>
<p>Identify the main purpose of the documentary</p>
<p>-The discoveries with ancient Mayan culture has implied the possibility of the presence of surgery before its reported history, and the documentary is rising the possibilities of extraterrestrial responsible for the issue. </p>
<p>What claims are proposed by the documentary? </p>
<p>- Scientific evidences support that the ancient Mayans did not have sufficient degree of scientific knowledge to operate surgery and cure diseases. However, some cases were reported from discoveries that they have cured those, believing it was their god who helped them. </p>
<p>What support is provided for those claims? </p>
<p>-Some historians claimed that extraterrestrials provided degree of technology to the ancients and they believed it as a god’s bless. </p>
<p>How is the documentary organized? </p>
<p>-The documentary introduces the background of medicine and medical technologies, and then rise of the issue and claims that they are correct by introducing hypothesizes and some evidences. </p>
<p>What methods are used to provide information to the audience? </p>
<p>-The surgical methods and layout of surgery room of ancient Inkans were similar. For example, European doctors punctured a hole in a patients brain to operate a brain surgery. In fact, historians discovered ancient skulls that had similar holes to that of European patient.</p>
<p>What conclusions can you draw about the genre of the documentary? </p>
<p>-This documentary rises a hypothesis which has some qualitative evidences, not scientific and statistical datas. Therefore, I would say the genre is science fiction . </p>
<p>This was similar to the in class activities. Documentary worksheet required us to evaluate the video on possibility of involvement of ancient aliens on medical technology and its legacy. This was a refreshment as the purpose of the worksheet is to watch and analyze ordinary documentaries we encounter. I was interested in ancient aliens in prior to the activity, and this interest helped me to focus better for the activity. </p>
<h1>Final thoughts</h1>
<p>-WRA 110 is a course that almost all Michigan State University students go through. It is also a course that teaches you what writing and reading really are. Although many incoming freshmen, including myself, surely have gone through high school education and finished numerous writing assignments, not that many knew what WRA 110 teaches you when they first enter college. In WRA 110, I learned how to write as a writer, rather than a student. I learned to consider audience and how my writing will be able to reach them better before starting writing, which I never did before this course. </p>
<p>Furthermore, WRA 110 with Dr. Daniels offers a bonus; in this course, students are required to complete web submissions in addition to offline essays. With the web submissions, students gradually constructed their on website with the HTML language. While the websites may not look fancy to those who are used to today’s vastly complicated and powerful websites, I am sure that it was a big step for many of us who took WRA 110. </p>
<p>Throughout the semester, I felt that the exercises and projects in WRA 110 were very well coordinated and connected with each other. The first two essays let me write more efficiently, effectively, and coherently. The third essay let me learn about how academic professionals read and write in order to communicate with each other. The fourth assignment allowed me to revisit one of the essays I wrote and to transmediate to a new form of medium. Finally, online portfolio let me practice construct the projects I finished into a functioning website. WRA 110 was a course that made a lasting impact on me, and I am grateful that I will be carrying the skills and knowledge I gained in this course throughout my college career and probably even further in my life. </p>
