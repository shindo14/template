<p>Blog entry</p>               
<p> The purpose of the video is to demonstrate a poem which represents the narrater's feelings towards his poem which he wrote in past and his uncle Ronnie.His toughts towards gay changed as he become homosexual, and it narrates his realization how his simmilar his life is with that of his uncle.
 
 he narrator starts his naration by explaining his feeling towards the poem. He vies the poem differnetly after he lost his wife and kids, and narrates the simmilarity between his and his uncle Ronnie's life. The narrater tries to express his sympathy towards his uncle Ronnie, and he then changes his narrating direction to overall status of homosexual society. He points out the biased stereotypes of homosexuals;He then speak out to other homosexuals not to self condemn, but be proud of themselves.
  
  he structure of the narration is simple but concise, and it efficiently transfered the narrator's feeling towards him and his uncle, further entire homosexuals. This structure of narration can be helpful for my Lived Experience Project as its structure focused on narrating his feeling towards the subject, not biased to the information about homosexuality. I can revise my project and inject my feelings towards the medical technology "Chuna" which I mentioned.
